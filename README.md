# Github port of my previous JupyterLab code
 
This is going to be where I start to code using Github, first by copying my code from Jupyter Lab into the main branch, and then experimenting with new code in a different branch, which will likely be called something along the lines of "Testing-Code" or "Testing-Graph".
